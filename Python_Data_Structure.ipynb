        " Key-Value Pairs\n",
        "\n",
        " The core of a dictionary is the concept of key-value pairs. Each pair consists of:\n",

        "A value: This can be any Python object, including numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, and more.   \n",
        "  Hashing  \n",

        "Key-Value Storage: Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs.  \n",
        "Collision Handling: If two different keys happen to have the same hash value (a \"collision\"), Python uses techniques like chaining (storing colliding pairs in a linked list) or open addressing (finding an alternative empty slot) to resolve the conflict.\n",
        "Benefits of this Approach  \n",
        "Fast Lookups: Given a key, Python can quickly calculate its hash value and directly access the corresponding bucket. This makes lookups very efficient, typically taking constant time (O(1)) on average.   \n",

        "\n",
        "- Tuples ensure data integrity in Python through their immutability. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed.   \n",
        " Here's how this immutability guarantees data integrity:\n",

        "Given a key, Python can quickly calculate its hash value and directly access the corresponding value, typically in constant time (O(1)) on average.\n",
        "How it Works (Simplified)\n",
        "\n",
        " Hashing: When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python calculates the hash value of the key.   \n",

        " Hashing and Dictionary Keys:\n",
        "\n",
        " Consistent Hashing: Immutable objects, like strings, can be used as keys in dictionaries. This is because their hash values (unique integer representations) remain constant. Consistent hashing is crucial for efficient dictionary lookups.\n",
